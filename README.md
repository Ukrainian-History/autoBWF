#autoBWF

A GUI tool for adding BWF internal metadata to WAV files. It calls FADGI BWFMetaEdit command line tools under the hood, and is meant to be a replacement for the BWFMetaEdit GUI. Unlike the latter, it is opinionated, and proposes metadata content based on the file name and file metadata based on the conventions of the Ukrainian History and Education Center Archives audio collections. It can be configured to have pre-set information for audio hardware, software, and copyright statements.
