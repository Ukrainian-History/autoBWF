#autoBWF

A GUI tool for adding de novo BWF internal metadata to freshly-digitized WAV files. It uses system calls to the FADGI BWFMetaEdit command line under the hood, and is meant to be a replacement for the BWFMetaEdit GUI for initial metadata creation. Unlike the BWFMetaEdit, autoBWF is highly opinionated, and proposes metadata content based on the file name and file metadata based on the conventions of the Ukrainian History and Education Center Archives audio collections. It can be configured to have pre-set data for audio hardware, software, and copyright statements.

autoBWF does not overwrite existing BWF metadata. Please use FADGI BWFMetaEdit for that purpose.

This code is not currently usable.
